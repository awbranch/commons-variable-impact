When law enforcement officers arrest or issue a citation to individuals suspected of committing a crime, they refer the case to the prosecutor’s office who will determine whether the evidence presented by law enforcement is sufficient to bring the charges to court."
2,Charging Decision,601,21,"642, 643",610,"644, 645",626,"646, 647","This section shows monthly data on the outcome of the charging decision, including the number and percentage of cases prosecuted in court and the number and percentage of cases rejected for prosecution.  Prosecutors review every single case that is referred to our office. We must ensure that the evidence supports the charges. When it does, we take the case to court. When it doesn’t, we reject the case for prosecution and close it."
3,Diversions,652,22,"657, 658, 659, 660",653,"661, 662, 663, 664",655,"669, 670, 671, 672","This section shows monthly data on the number and percentage of cases involving defendants accepted into a pretrial diversion program. Pretrial diversion programs offer eligible defendants an alternative to traditional prosecution in court and address needs such as mental health, addiction, and homelessness. After the program is completed, the case is dismissed. Pretrial diversion is an evidence-based way of reducing recidivism while keeping individuals accountable for their actions."

There are six general stages of the criminal justice process: offense, entry into the system (via arrest or citation), charging decision (or when the prosecutor decides whether to take the case to court or not), arraignment (or first appearance in court), disposition (or case resolution), and sentencing (or the penalty imposed after conviction). Each step of the process must proceed in a timely fashion to ensure that victims’ and defendants’ rights are protected, and to prevent costly backlogs in the system."

Cases may be resolved in multiple ways depending on the strength of the evidence. Cases may be rejected for prosecution if the evidence doesn’t support the charges. They can be dismissed or result in the defendant’s acquittal when guilt cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Or they can result in the defendant’s conviction when the evidence overwhelmingly points to guilt either by admission or by trial."
